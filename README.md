# Ohio University Green Roof Data Tools
### Background
Ohio University began its green roof sustainability initiative project in 2019 after receiving a series of grants, including an Academic Innovation Accelerator grant. The objectives of the initiative are the minimization of carbon emissions along with helping to reach the long term goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. The deployment of the green roof is intended to reduce energy demands, decrease stormwater accumulation, improve air quality, and help lower carbon emissions. The initiative is an interdisciplinary project involving faculty members from Ohio University’s College of Arts and Sciences, Scripps College, Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs, Russ College of Engineering and Technology, and Patton College of Education. Undergraduate and graduate students are also involved through courses, PACE, graduate assistant positions, and The Green Initiative (a student organization). 

Over the last year, preparations have been made for the green roof’s deployment atop Ohio University’s Schoonover Center. Over the span of 2019, multiple data collecting devices were placed atop the roof and have been collecting relevant climate data. The initial plan called for the final construction of the green roof to begin in Spring of 2020, but work was delayed until the summer of 2020. 

To measure the progress and effectiveness of the green roof, large amounts of data must be collected before and after construction of the roof. The challenge of data collection and display, is the centralization and accessibility of the data. It is essential students and faculty are able to access and visualize the data retrieved by each sensor in a central location. It is also important this data is publicly accessible, yet secure and integrous.

All green roof data is collected and centralized using Zabbix network monitoring software and other scripting tools. This project also provides an alternative web app solution for collection and centralization.
